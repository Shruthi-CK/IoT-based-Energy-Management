# Implementation of Demand Response Management of Microgrids using IoT and Machine Learning

## Description
Accounting for the increasing power demands and the need to conserve natural resources, developing a grid system that can integrate renewable power resources and produce energy efficiently is necessary. This can be executed by using a microgrid arrangement that allows discrete energy management and the implementation of appropriate management strategies.

Demand response management is a system where the customer actively reduces demand during peak hours in response to some financial benefits. The proposed research has developed and simulated a demand response management system with microgrids using potentiometers to depict the continuous load variation and applied dynamic pricing and incentivization techniques to bring about active customer involvement in meeting the demand and increasing the grid's reliability. Using IoT, all the information regarding load demand, generation, and cost is continuously recorded and made readily available to the customer on the web. IoT also provides customers with a convenient method to reduce their demand during peak hours. Machine learning algorithms are used for fruitful load forecasting to get some insight and make intelligent decisions associated with the system.
